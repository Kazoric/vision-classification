# Vision - Image Classification Module

This project provides a Python module for image classification featuring various popular pretrained and custom models. It includes multiple architectures and a modular design with a shared base class.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Implementation of several image classification models:
  - VGG
  - DenseNet
  - MobileNet
  - ResNet
  - Wide ResNet
- A `model_base` class inherited by all models to ensure easy extensibility and maintenance.
- Two `data_loader` classes to handle CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 dataset loading.
- Modular and extensible design to easily integrate new models or datasets.
