# Vision - Image Classification Module

This project provides a Python module for image classification featuring various popular and custom models. It includes multiple architectures and a modular design with a shared base class.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Implementation of several image classification models:
  - VGG
  - DenseNet
  - MobileNet
  - ResNet
  - Wide ResNet
- A `Model` class in `model_base.py` that provides:
  - Training
  - Evaluation
  - Checkpoint saving and loading
  - Prediction
  - Accuracy and loss plotting
- Each model file defines:
  - `Architecture`: the PyTorch model architecture class
  - `Model`: the class declaring the model, including a `build_model` method to instantiate the architecture
- Two `data_loader` classes to handle CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 dataset loading
- Modular and extensible design to easily add new models or datasets
